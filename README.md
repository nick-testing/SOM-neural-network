## Prerquirements
 - [hexalattice](https://github.com/alexkaz2/hexalattice) for graphical display of the hexagonal grid
    - can be installed using `pip install hexalattice`
  - Python 3 and above
  - Tested on Linux, might run on Windows as well


## Running the program

Simply run `python3 som_network.py <path_to_csv_file>` where path_to_csv_file is the path to the chosen CSV file.

Sample .csv file provided in the example_data folder, and the algorithm was tuned for it.
